        <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to TRNG Web Service!</h1>
        <p class="lead">We are serving True Random Numbers to anyone on the internet.</p>
        <p>You might have pondered how machines, which are inherently deterministic, can produce randomness. In fact,
            most random
            numbers utilized in computer programs are pseudo-random. This means they are produced in a predictable
            manner using a
            mathematical formula. While this is adequate for a wide range of applications, it may not provide the
            randomness you
            anticipate if you’re accustomed to the unpredictability of dice rolls or lottery drawings.</p>
        <p>Unlike pseudo-random number
            generators that
            use mathematical formulas, the TRNG web service generates randomness from a fundamentally unpredictable
            physical process
            - thermal noise. Thermal noise, also known as Johnson-Nyquist noise, is the electronic noise generated by
            the thermal
            agitation of the charge carriers inside an electrical conductor. This noise is a powerful source of
            randomness because
            it’s inherently unpredictable and cannot be reliably reproduced. This makes the TRNG web service an
            excellent choice
            when you need true randomness in your applications.</p>
